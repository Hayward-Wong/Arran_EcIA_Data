## Description
This is a public repository where I included all the contents such as Data, Codes and Extra for the Lochranza Ecological Impact Assessment

## Summary
the Northern Plot is recommended for commercial forestry development due to
its potential benefits to the prioritised Red squirrels, higher bird abundance of least
concerned species, the presence of invasive species that could be managed through
forestry, and the lack of SSSI status, which provides more flexibility in management
decisions. This recommendation aligns with the need to balance economic development with
ecological conservation, preserving the sensitive Southern Plot for its ecological significance
and unique biodiversity
